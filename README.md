# # Ask Phill Assignment.

I wanted to do this website page using only HTML and SCSS.
Most of the page was ok to code. There were easy parts and more challenging ones.
The hardest part for me was the carousel. During my studies I always used bootstrap or javascript for it(usually finding the code online).Even for this website I used codepen for the carousels code as I was not able to come up with it. Theoretically I understand how it works but I am not yet able to code it myself.
I tried to break the website down in as many reusable elements as possible so it would be easier to code the rest of the website. This is only my second try at doing a project this way (SCSS, BEM, file structure) so I know it will get better with a few more tries. So far I have used Bootstrap's grid system but for this I created my own grid. I am currently planing to start learning CSS grids to make coding easier and my life better. If needed I can add media queries to this assignment to make it more responsive(especially the navbar and text) but that would take me some more time. If you have any questions regarding my code, please let me know.
